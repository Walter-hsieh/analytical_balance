 complete computer emulation.  You can emulate a mouse and all of the computer keyboard keys.
 See your device manual for complete information.</P>
<P>If your device does not include these pages, you will need to program it for computer emulation or load special vocabulary that includes these commands. See the Computer Emulation section of your manuals.</P>
